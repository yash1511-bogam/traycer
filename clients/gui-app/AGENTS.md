# AGENTS.md — clients/gui-app

GUI renderer for Traycer. Read with repo-root `AGENTS.md`. Treat as a normal
browser React app unless the task needs native/desktop integration.

**Stack:** Vite, React, TS, TanStack Router (file-based) + Query, Zustand,
Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Vitest + Testing Library.

## Commands

```bash
# from clients/gui-app/
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run compile
bun run react-doctor   # manual after .ts/.tsx changes; not in pre-commit
```

Changed-files-only: `npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose --diff <base> --offline --no-score`.

**Commits:** don't manually run `compile` / `build` / `lint` / `format` before
committing — repo-root `pre-commit` already runs the affected checks (see root
`AGENTS.md`). Tests are CI, not the hook. Re-run checks only when diagnosing
failures. `react-doctor` stays manual (not hooked).

## Non-negotiable rules

- **`cn(...)`** from `@/lib/utils` for all composed `className`s. No template
  literals / `+` / `.join(" ")`. Static single strings OK.
- **Fluid layout sizing** — `w-full`, `max-w-*`, viewport caps. No fixed px/rem
  for layout surfaces (icons / touch targets OK). One recorded exception:
  Settings ▸ Layout's status-bar preview frame
  (`panels/layout/status-bar-preview.tsx`) is a SIMULATED viewport whose width
  control names a pixel width, so it draws `w-[480px]` / `w-[880px]` /
  `w-[920px]` — always under `max-w-full`, since a frame wider than the
  ~944px Settings pane silently pushes the strip's right-hand cluster
  off-screen. A new fixed-px layout width needs the same kind of argument.
- **Safe area** — never write `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; `index.css` owns the
  only reads. `#root` reserves the top and both horizontal insets app-wide
  (landscape is supported, so the sensor housing can be on either side), which
  makes every in-flow surface safe with no code of its own. Those edges have no
  opt-out, for content and surface backgrounds alike. What is left to a
  surface: the bottom edge (`pb-safe-bottom`), and anything `fixed`.
  - Window-filling: `h-safe-dvh` / `min-h-safe-svh` / `w-safe-dvw`, never the
    raw `h-dvh` / `min-h-svh` / `w-screen`.
  - Floating over the viewport: the `*-safe-<edge>-gutter` tokens, which are
    the layout's own 1rem or the device inset, whichever is larger.
  - `fixed` overlays are portalled outside `#root` and inset themselves:
    `top-safe-center-y` + `left-safe-center-x` when centred (the horizontal
    centre is displaced by half the DIFFERENCE between the side insets, since
    the landscape housing is only ever on one side), `top-safe-top` when
    full-height, and `max-w-safe-dvw` to cap width. CSS allows one width clamp
    per element, so that cap is a default a call site can displace with an
    unmodified `max-w-*`, not a floor — the contract test is the other half of
    the guarantee. Where a
    primitive already owns `inset-y-0`/`h-full` under a `data-*` variant, use
    `mt-safe-top` + `h-safe-dvh` under that **same** variant —
    `tailwind-merge` only displaces a class whose modifiers match, and its
    conflict map lets `inset-y-*` displace `top-*` but not the reverse, so a
    bare `top-safe-top` ties on specificity instead of winning. `sheet.tsx` and
    `drawer.tsx` already do this per side, so their callers need nothing.
  - A full-screen dim is not a surface and stays edge to edge.
  - **The one sanctioned full-bleed surface** is `StandaloneShell`
    (`routes/root-route-components.tsx`) — sign-in and the tour. It is `fixed
inset-0` and marked `data-full-bleed-surface`, so it takes the viewport
    instead of sitting inside `#root`'s reservation, and its edge-to-edge
    artwork reaches the status bar. The exception covers the BACKGROUND only:
    each surface inside it insets its own content layer, because artwork and
    content are siblings there. `fixed` escapes `#root` wholesale, so a content
    layer must restore **all three** reservations — top and both sides —
    plus the bottom wherever that surface has content near it. Restoring only
    the top reads as handled and still fails in landscape; a band whose
    HEIGHT clears the home indicator does not clear it for a line box centred
    inside that band. Do not add a second full-bleed surface — the contract
    test asserts the marker appears exactly once.
  - New tokens must also be registered in `cn()`'s `extendTailwindMerge`
    (`lib/utils.ts`) or they never conflict with the utility they override —
    which is invisible on desktop, where every inset is zero.
  - When a library takes geometry as a value rather than a style (Radix
    `collisionPadding`), read `readSafeAreaInsets()` from
    `lib/safe-area-insets.ts`. It is the only sanctioned runtime read; do not
    add another `getComputedStyle` call site.
- Prefer composition over editing `src/components/ui/`.
- Spinners: `AgentSpinningDots` only — no new ad-hoc spinners.
- **Never fill with `bg-muted` on a raised surface.** Every preset theme's
  dark variant defines `--muted` identical to `--popover` and `--card`, and
  the flat light presets (github, gruvbox, tokyo-night, nord, everforest)
  collapse it into `--background` too — so a muted fill inside a dialog,
  popover, dropdown, or card is _invisible_, and only the default light/dark
  pair makes it look right. `--accent` never collapses but is too weak to
  substitute (1.05–1.15 in preset darks). Use an alpha of the foreground,
  which is surface-independent by construction: `bg-foreground/8` for a
  solid fill or an interaction state, `/10` for a skeleton, `/6 · /5 · /3`
  descending for tints. `bg-muted` stays fine for zones on `bg-background` /
  `bg-canvas`, and `bg-muted-foreground` (a text color) is unaffected.
  The rule is about the RENDERED fill, not the utility class, so it binds in
  raw CSS too: `var(--muted)` in a `@keyframes` frame or behind a custom
  property collapses identically and no class-level sweep can see it. Watch
  terminal frames especially — an `animation: … both` frame is not a hand-off
  back to the class, it is the element's permanent background from then on.
  `src/__tests__/muted-fill-on-raised-surface-lint.test.ts` guards the `.tsx`
  half and takes a per-line `// muted-fill-ok: <reason>` waiver for a fill a
  collapse cannot erase — the surface does not collapse (`bg-canvas`), or an
  explicit border or a second state channel survives it.
- No `key={x ?? fallback}` when `undefined` already remounts correctly.
- Zustand = client UI state; TanStack Query = server/host data.
- Keep browser-safe unless the task adds a native host.
- **Local browser tiles are CSS-anchored `<webview>` guests.** Overlay
  primitives paint in ordinary DOM stacking above the guest. Importing a
  Radix portal primitive directly outside `src/components/ui/` is still
  banned by the `overlayPortal` ESLint block so portal behavior stays in the
  shadcn wrappers. Toast placement may consult live tile rects; there is no
  native-view occlusion coordinator, snapshot stand-in, or motion freeze.

## Backend calls → TanStack Query

Every host RPC / AuthService / RunnerHost request goes through Query. No
`useState` loading flags or ad-hoc `toast.error` in components.

| Kind     | Use                                                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host RPC | `useHostQuery` / `useHostMutation` / `useHostQueries` (owns host key + null gate) |
| Non-host | bare `useQuery` / `useMutation` + key from `src/lib/query-keys/`                  |

- Return full `UseQueryResult` / `UseMutationResult` — don't narrow.
- Hook names: `use<Namespace><Verb><Noun>` (e.g. `useEpicCreate`).
- Default cache update: `invalidateQueries` in `onSuccess`. Optimistic
  `setQueryData` only when justified.
- Host-swap races: capture `hostId` in `onMutate`, use it in
  `onSuccess`/`onError`.
- Errors: `toastFromHostError` / `toastFromAuthError` / `toastFromRunnerError`
  in `onError` (omit only for inline-error surfaces).
- Pending UX: `disabled={isPending}` + unchanged label + inline
  `AgentSpinningDots`. Never swap labels ("Submitting…").
- Never inline `["mutation", "..."]` keys — add builders under
  `src/lib/query-keys/`.

Host scope: tab tiles use `useTabHostId()` / `useTabHostClient()`; app-wide
surfaces use `useEffectiveHostId()` / `useHostClient()`. Don't mix.
`useEffectiveHostId()` is the selection authority's DERIVED host (selection
model §1) — one decider per app, delivered to every window. Settings ▸ Activate
is the only UI gesture that changes it; no picker anywhere writes it, and
`HostDirectoryService.selectById` is lint-restricted to the one authority
bridge. Surface pickers write a per-surface pin (`useSurfaceHostPin`), and a
surface with no pin resolves to `useEffectiveHostId()`.

**A pin is a preference, not a binding** — the same two-tier shape as
preferred/effective, one tier down. `resolvedHostId` is the pin while its host
can serve and `effective` while it cannot, so a surface whose pinned host dies
AUTO-FOLLOWS and returns on its own when the host is usable again. The pin is
never cleared by death; that is what makes the return sticky. Only deliberate
deregistration clears it (the host left the account — a pointer to nothing),
mirroring the authority's own `clearPreferredOutsideFleet`, empty-fleet guard
included. Death is `lease.status === "dead"` and deliberately NOT
`!isUsableForSelection`: `restarting-expected` is a hold, and an incumbent
holds through an expected restart exactly as the app-wide failover does.
Read `honoredSelection`, never `selection`, when resolving a client — the raw
pin still names the dead host. There is no dead-state banner: the chip renders
the RESOLVED host, and the dead host's own picker row says `offline`.

Composers have a **target host** (tab host, fork dialog's fixed host, the
new-conversation modal's host). `null` means "this surface owns its
placement", and the two surfaces that own one resolve it differently:

- the **landing composer** resolves its WINDOW-keyed pin ?? `effective`
  (`useComposerPlacement`);
- the **in-Epic new-conversation modal** resolves its per-**EPIC** pin ?? the
  Epic session's host ?? `effective` (`useEpicConversationPlacement`). The
  per-Epic pin is that Epic's _last created chat's host_: the picker writes
  it, and every create in the modal re-records it — the same memory shape as
  the model picker's last-used settings. So a new agent in an Epic opens on
  the host the last one was created on, or before any on the host the Epic is
  served from — never on wherever the window's landing chip last pointed,
  which is not a fact about the Epic. Every in-Epic trigger (the sidebar `+`,
  a row's "new child", the palette's new-agent items) passes `hostId: null`
  for that reason; only a trigger with a machine genuinely in mind (a terminal
  quote, whose terminal exists on one host) names one, and naming freezes the
  picker (§55).

Only a placement that `effective` answered FOLLOWS a derivation move
(`ComposerPlacement.followsEffective`); one resting on a pin or on the Epic's
host is not re-pointed by one and does not narrate one.

**The composer is PLACEMENT.** Its resolved host (the pin rule above, keyed per
WINDOW) decides where a created epic/chat lives for life, so its picker writes
that pin and never the app-wide selection. Submit re-validates: a host the
CALLER NAMED (the row-scoped modal's `overrideHostId`) must not be dead, and —
named, pinned or following — the client the create is about to be sent on must
still address the resolved host, else the composer refuses inline and creates
nothing, never a silent fallback onto whatever the window is bound to. A PIN
does not reach that first refusal: it re-resolves to `effective` instead, and
the chip has been showing that host since it moved. An override does, because
naming the machine IS the request. There is deliberately no separate
reachability gate on the following path: usability of the effective host is the
selection authority's call (selection model §1), and re-deriving it here would
be a second decider.
A create that resolves its host separately from the chip is the bug this
structure exists to prevent; route new composer creates through the placement
the chip is showing.

Every host RPC around a
composer — mentions, slash commands, harness/model catalog, providers/profiles,
pack retry, catalog refresh — and every surface that dispatches into the
focused composer (the palette's Pick provider/model, via
`FocusedComposerEntry.hostClient`) resolves through that host's client
(`…ForClient` hooks / `runTargetHostId` → `useHostClientForHostId`). The
default-host wrappers (`useProvidersList()`, `useGuiHarness*Query()`) are for
app-wide surfaces only (prefetcher, Settings, a palette with no focused
composer) — never inside a composer surface. (`useDefaultHostClient()` was the
third of these and is gone: once `HostRuntimeBinding` carried its own `hostId`
it resolved exactly what `useHostClient()` resolves.)

**"Default host" means the SURFACE's host**, which inside Settings is the
SCOPED one, not the app-wide one. A binding re-provided by a host-scoped panel
names its host (`HostRuntimeBinding.hostId`), and every consumer below it —
`useHostClient()`, `useAddressableHostId()`, the wrappers above — resolves to
that host. Eleven surfaces re-provide — nine through `useScopedHostBinding`,
plus the two governed exceptions it lists. Resolve a binding through
`lib/host/binding-host-client.ts` and never inline
`hostClient.createRequesterForHostId(...)` beside a separately-read host id:
that pairing is a defect with its own history, and those resolvers are pure
functions taking the binding as an ARGUMENT precisely so a consumer's own
`useHostBinding()` — including a test's — is what they see.

Persisted "last used" and pending state is per-host too:
`composer-run-settings-store`, `composer-harness-memory-store`,
`workspace-folders-store`, and `worktree-intent-memory-store` bucket by
`hostId` (the toolbar store carries it in `catalog.hostId`; a `null` host
drops the write), and every `WorktreeStagingKey` carries the host its slot
stages for. A new read/write of any of these must pass the composer's target
host — never the flat pre-bucket shape.

Anything keyed by a bare **local path** belongs in this set: the same string
names a different directory on two machines, so an unbucketed map silently
merges them. Do not reason that a key is "already host-bound" because its id
happens to imply one host (a chat id, an owner id) — that holds only until
someone adds a slot keyed by an epic or a draft, and nothing checks it. The
migrated memory stores keep their pre-bucket data as a read-only `legacy*`
fallback consulted per key, so a single-host install keeps its memory. That
tier is **transitional**: the first host to act (write or sweep) adopts it
wholesale into its own bucket and retires it, because an unattributed tier
that several hosts read is the same leak in miniature — and one that never
terminates, since a host that supersedes a legacy choice and later has that
entry purged would fall back to the superseded one. Staging slots are pending
picks, so their v1 data is dropped rather than carried.

A host-scoped store also needs its **invalidations** scoped. A worktree sweep
is one machine's filesystem event, so `purgeRemovedWorktreeIntents` (both
stores) takes the swept `hostId` and touches only that host's slots — an
identically-named path or branch on another host still materializes there.
Contrast `clearEpicIntent`, which is account-wide: the epic is gone
everywhere.

`worktreeStagingKeyString` puts the host segment first and percent-encodes it,
so a `:` in a host id can never split the key; an empty segment is the
unresolved-host bucket. Anything that parses a serialized key (the
persistability filter, the purge) counts segments from that layout — add a
segment and both must move with it.

**Deliberate exception — dictation.** `useDictationAvailability` /
`useVoiceDictation` stay on the app-wide host (`useHostClient()`) even inside a
host-pinned composer. They describe the person at the keyboard, not the run:
`speech.dictate` streams live microphone audio and `speech.ensureModel`
downloads an on-device model, so following a remote run target would ship a
user's audio to a machine they only picked to execute a turn on, and drop a
model download there. The cost is real and accepted — a composer pinned to
host B gates its mic on the app-wide host's model, not B's. Scope a NEW
composer RPC to the target host unless it is about the human's input devices.

## Opening seams (links + tiles)

Two boundaries, both enforced by `eslint/traycer-tile-open-boundary-rules.mjs`
(a `no-restricted-syntax` dimension in `eslint.config.mjs`, so oxlint gets it
through `oxlint-config-adapter.mjs` too):

- **URL egress** — `useOpenLink()(url, kind, event)` (`lib/links/open-link.ts`),
  never a raw `openExternalLink`, `window.open`, or `target="_blank"`. Pick the
  `LinkKind`; it decides in-app vs external.
- **Tile open** — `useEpicTileNavigation().openTile(intent)` (or
  `openTileWithNavigation` outside a component), never a
  `prepare*FocusTarget` action. The intent carries placement, dedupe and source.

Exemptions are per file with a stated reason in `eslint.config.mjs`; the
nested-focus dimension still bans the raw store actions underneath.

## Routing

- Auth/redirects → route `beforeLoad`; search → `validateSearch`; critical
  data → route `loader` + Query prefetch. Not component effects.
- Don't mutate UI/stores from preload paths (`beforeLoad`/`loader` may run
  before commit).
- Effects only for external sync (router↔store, streams, browser APIs).

## Testing

Prefer integrated tests (real stores/docs/watchers) over isolated units. Fake
only external/nondeterministic boundaries. Reset stores between tests; use
Testing Library role queries.

## Terminal theming (xterm)

Invariants only — read `src/lib/theme-applier.ts`, `terminal-theme.ts`,
`lib/themes/builtin-palettes.ts` before changing:

- `theme-applier.ts` owns `<html>` class / `data-theme` (module-load, outside
  React). Don't write those attributes elsewhere.
- Palette data (including `--term-ansi-*`) lives in `lib/themes/builtin-palettes.ts`; the applier writes the registered CSS tokens. Add presets to that registry, never theme-name CSS selectors.
- `buildTerminalTheme` is sync (no flash); unset bright slots L-shift at runtime.
- Lazy-load `TerminalXtermHost`; clear atlas via `scheduleAtlasClear`.
