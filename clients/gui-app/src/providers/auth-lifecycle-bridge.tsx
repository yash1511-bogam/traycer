/**
 * Renderer-side bridge that disposes every live Epic, chat, and terminal
 * session whenever the authenticated identity changes - sign-out, user-switch,
 * or a token expiry that lands the user back on the signed-out auth surface.
 *
 * The teardown is deliberately whole-registry: even resources the new identity
 * also has access to must be re-acquired so the next snapshot and chat
 * subscription land fresh. Without this, prior-user Y.Doc bytes, unsynced
 * edits, last-focused state, and live chat/terminal stream state (including a
 * warm terminal-agent session, which the terminal registry keeps lease-free
 * with no idle TTL) would leak into the next session.
