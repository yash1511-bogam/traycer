 *
 * Deferred until the stream client binds (`useWsStreamClient()` is `null` during
 * the initial host-hydration gap); the effect re-runs when it becomes available.

 * the entry, so the stream stays closed. Both booleans join the effect deps so
 * toggling a setting live acquires/releases without remounting the pane.
