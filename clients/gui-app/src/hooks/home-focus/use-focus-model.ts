/**
 * The Home focus view's whole data contract, joined from the stores this client
 * already runs. No RPC of its own beyond two batched reads (task titles by id,
 * and the host's per-epic indicator flags), and no protocol change.
 *
 * ## Hook-count stability
 *
 * The number of tasks and warm chats changes as agents start, tiles open and
 * the session cap evicts - so nothing here may call a hook per row. Every
 * dynamic set is read through ONE subscription that publishes a value-comparable
 * snapshot: `useMountedEpicProjection` for names and parentage,
 * `useWarmChatBackground` for shells and background items,
 * `useEpicGetTaskContexts` for titles (which batches ids into cap-sized
 * requests inside a single `useHostQueries`).
 *
 * ## Task titles and their staleness
 *
 * Two sources, in this precedence:
 *
 * 1. A MOUNTED epic's live Y.Doc title, which is what the tab strip shows and
 *    updates the instant someone renames the task.
 * 2. The cloud task index (`epic.getTaskContexts`, five-minute stale window).
 *
 * Which means a title here can be BEHIND for a task not open in this window,
 * and ABSENT for a brand-new task the cloud index has not published yet -
 * `null`, not a placeholder. Rendering an id is honest; inventing "Untitled" as
 * if it were the task's name is not. Not `useHistoryQuery`, the app's other
 * title reader: it resolves a SEARCH PAGE (with debouncing, local fuzzy ranking
 * and worktree probes) and would answer for the epics that happen to be on the
 * current page rather than the epics that are actually running.
 * `useEpicGetTaskContexts` is the by-id primitive `useHistoryQuery` itself uses
 * for exactly this, and it is documented as the presentation-only title reader.
 *
 * ## The indicator batch cap
 *
 * `host.notifications.indicatorState` is capped at
 * `HOST_NOTIFICATIONS_INDICATOR_BATCH_CAP` ids per request, and the query hook
 * pages beyond it by issuing MORE requests. This surface asks about at most one
 * page: an install with more than 500 simultaneously-running tasks would
 * otherwise fan out an unbounded number of RPCs to decorate rows nobody can
 * read. Epics past the cap still resolve `needsYou` from a loaded prompt row -
 * they lose only the host's flags for a prompt this client has not paged in.
 * The ids are sorted before slicing so the covered set is stable rather than
 * re-drawn on every frame.
