/**
 * The app's bottom strip: provider usage on the left, the watched host and its
 * resource readout on the right.
 *
 * The watch host is resolved ONCE, here, above every segment — and re-provided
 * as this subtree's `HostRuntimeContext` and `StreamRuntimeContext`. That pair
 * of swaps is what re-targets the whole strip: the unary context moves the RPC
 * reads and their query keys, the streaming one moves `resources.subscribe`.
 * Swapping only the first is how a surface ends up reading host B's RPCs beside
 * host A's live stream, which is why both are here rather than one being left
 * to whichever segment happens to need it.
 *
 * Both providers are rendered unconditionally, and that is load-bearing rather
 * than tidiness — the same reason `RateLimitIconButton` states. Mounting one
 * only when a scoped binding exists changes the element type at this position
 * the moment a pick resolves, so React unmounts the whole subtree and mounts a
 * fresh one, taking the open state of anything inside it (the host list, the
 * resource panel) with it. The fallback re-provides the ambient binding
 * VERBATIM, never a copy, so an unscoped strip still sees ambient updates.
