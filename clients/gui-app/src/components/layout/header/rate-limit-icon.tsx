 * Header trigger for the provider rate-limit popover, scoped to the host the
 * popover's own picker selected.
 *
 * The scope is resolved HERE, above both the glyph and the popover, and
 * re-provided as this subtree's `HostRuntimeContext`. That one swap is what
 * re-targets the whole surface: every hook below reaches its host through
 * `useHostClient()` / `useAddressableHostId()`, and both read the binding
 * from context, so the query keys, the serial fetch queue's scope and the
 * invalidations all move together and cannot end up describing different
 * machines. Nothing outside this subtree moves — picking a host to WATCH is
 * not picking where new work lands (`stores/rate-limits/rate-limit-popover-store`).
 *
 * `useScopedHostBinding` returns null while the pick is the active host, or
 * while it has not resolved to its own client — in both cases the value below
 * falls back to the AMBIENT binding, which is exactly what this subtree read
 * before there was a picker at all.
 *
 * The provider is rendered unconditionally, and that is load-bearing rather
 * than tidiness. Mounting it only when a scoped binding exists changes the
 * element type at this position the moment a pick resolves, so React unmounts
 * the whole subtree and mounts a fresh one — taking the popover's own `open`
 * state with it. The popover therefore closed the instant a host was chosen
 * from the picker inside it, which is to say the control could not be used.
 * The fallback re-provides the ambient binding VERBATIM (never a copy), so a
 * subtree that is not scoped still sees ambient binding updates.
