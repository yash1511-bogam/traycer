 * deliberately left alone — every mutation this panel fires already pins its
 * own transient client to the row's `hostId` (`resources.kill`,
 * `managedCommand.stop`), and the host directory the picker itself reads is
 * app-wide.
 *
 * `useScopedStreamBinding` returns null while the pick is the active host, or
 * while it has not resolved to its own client — in both cases the value below
 * falls back to the AMBIENT binding, which is exactly what this subtree read
 * before there was a picker at all.
 *
 * The provider is rendered unconditionally, and that is load-bearing rather
 * than tidiness: mounting it only when a scoped binding exists changes the
 * element type at this position the moment a pick resolves, so React would
 * unmount the whole subtree and take the popover's own `open` state with it —
 * closing the panel the instant a host was chosen from the picker inside it.
