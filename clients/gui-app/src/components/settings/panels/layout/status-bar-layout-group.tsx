          `Show resource monitor` governs the same thing, and two switches over
          one segment is one of them lying.

          The viewport is the second half of that question and not a second
          question. Below `md` the shell drops the strip whatever `placement`
          says (`AppShell`) and `MobileAppHeader` keeps this monitor, so a
          desktop window narrowed into a split screen would otherwise leave the
          only monitor on screen with no switch anywhere - the group's own
          `Show resource monitor` governs a strip that is not drawn.
          `MobileStatusBarLayoutGroup` makes exactly this argument for the
          installed app. The GROUP stays on the build rather than the viewport:
          a temporarily narrow window must not hide the placement setting.

          So below `md` under `status-bar` placement BOTH switches are on
          screen, which is the exception to the rule above and is deliberate:
          the alternative is neither. Nothing here says which one is currently
          live, because it is not this row's to say - every other control in
          the group configures that undrawn strip too, and the preview's
          caption above is the page's one answer for all of them. */}
