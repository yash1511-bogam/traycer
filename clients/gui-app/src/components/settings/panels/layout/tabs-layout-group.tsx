/**
 * What the top-level tab strip carries.
 *
 * Its own group rather than a row borrowed by the Status bar one: a tab is not
 * part of the footer, and the footer group collapses on a build where these
 * controls still apply. Nothing here keys on `isMobileApp()` for that reason -
 * the mobile app has no strip, but it draws what these rows govern (the Home
 * tab becomes the first entry in the nav drawer), so the group renders whole on
 * every build.
 *
 * It is a group rather than a loose row because the strip is a surface with
 * more than one question to answer, and because a group that exists is where
 * the next such control lands instead of being parked wherever looked closest -
 * which is exactly what `Home density` did.
 *
 * Home's OTHER preference, which of its two views is showing, is deliberately
 * not here. It is written by a control on the page itself and persists its last
 * selection; a Settings row would be a second place to answer a question the
 * page answers better, and one the user would have to leave Home to change.
