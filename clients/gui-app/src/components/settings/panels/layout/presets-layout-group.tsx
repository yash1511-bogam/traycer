/**
 * The whole page in one click, and the way back.
 *
 * First group on the page because it is the coarsest control on it: a reader
 * who wants "less chrome" should not have to find the eleven rows that say so,
 * and a reader who wants one row still scrolls past this to reach it. Every
 * row below stays exactly as reachable as it was - a preset writes the same
 * store keys those rows write, so the page after a click is a page the user
 * could have arrived at by hand.
 *
 * **There is no "selected preset" state.** The pressed segment is derived from
 * the stores on every render, so changing any row below flips this to `Custom`
 * at once rather than leaving a stale badge claiming a preset the page no
 * longer matches. `Custom` is shown as a fourth, unpressable segment: it is a
 * verdict, not a choice, and a control that offered it would be offering to
 * change nothing.
 *
 * **The segment and the button are not the same gesture.** `Default` is the
 * third DENSITY bundle - it leaves the strip's placement and the rail exactly
 * where they are, as Compact and Detailed do. `Reset to defaults` puts the
 * whole page back, those two included, which is why it stays enabled on a page
 * already reading `Default` whose strip has been moved or whose rail has been
 * rearranged: there is still something for it to undo.
 *
 * Reset asks nothing first. The page is autosave and every value it writes is
 * one click from coming back, so a confirm would be a dialog guarding
 * something less destructive than the rows it sits above.
