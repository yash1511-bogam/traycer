/**
 * The runtime binding a host-scoped panel re-provides so every hook beneath it
 * targets the host the page is SHOWING rather than a spine that names none.
 *
 * THE ONE implementation FOR A `HostScope`, with two governed exceptions. It
 * used to claim to be the only one anywhere — `providers-settings-panel.tsx`
 * had carried a byte-equivalent copy inline — and that claim was false when it
 * was written, which is worse than no claim: an audit that trusted it missed
 * two live copies. The honest list, and why each is legitimate:
 *
 *   - `agent-selection-guide-section.tsx` re-provides on `ready` ONLY, with no
 *     `following` arm. A deliberate narrowing, not an oversight: its gate holds
 *     non-usable children in a hidden `<Activity>`, so it needs no third state.
 *   - `provider-reauth-banner.tsx` is TAB-bound, not scope-bound — its client is
 *     `useTabHostClient()` and its host `useTabHostId()`. It has no `HostScope`
 *     to hand this hook, so it structurally cannot use it.
 *
 * TEN surfaces re-provide `HostRuntimeContext` in total: the eight through
 * this hook (`rate-limit-icon`, `shell`, `diagnostics`, `providers`, `host`,
 * `app-status-bar` — the bottom strip, which re-provides for the host it
 * watches — `layout`, whose per-provider status-bar toggles read the same watch
 * pick the strip does, and the onboarding TOUR) plus those two. Anything
 * reading `useHostClient()` / `useAddressableHostId()` beneath any of them
 * gets that surface's host.
 *
 * The tour (`onboarding-page.tsx`) is the eighth, and the first outside
 * Settings-shaped surfaces: its two host-dependent acts read one machine -
 * the session scan lists what is on it, the agent guide is stored on it - so
 * a person with several hosts can run the tour once and still import into,
 * and write a guide for, whichever machine they name. It re-provides BOTH
 * contexts for that reason, and it is safe for the positional reason below:
 * the tour has no composer, and so no path to the microphone.
 *
 * The session-import DIALOG (`session-import-dialog.tsx`) is the ninth, for
 * the same reason as the tour's import act: it carries its own host picker,
 * and the scan it shows and the run it starts belong to the machine that
 * picker names. It also re-provides BOTH contexts, and contains no composer.
 *
 * ⚠ A RE-PROVIDER MUST NOT WRAP A SURFACE CONTAINING THE MIC PATH.
 * `useDictationAvailability` reads `useHostClient()` and is app-wide BY DESIGN
 * (see its own doc and `AGENTS.md`): `speech.dictate` streams live microphone
 * audio, so pointing it at a pinned host ships a user's voice to a machine they
 * only picked to administer. Today it is safe only because no re-provider
 * happens to sit above a composer — a positional fact, not an invariant, which
 * is why it is written down here where the tenth re-provider gets added. The
 * two most recent are the bottom strip and Layout's status-bar group, and both
 * are safe for that same positional reason: a 24px strip holds usage segments
 * and a readout, a Settings group holds toggles, and no composer will ever be a
 * child of either.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE RULE BINDS `StreamRuntimeContext` AT LEAST AS HARD, which this
 * note used to imply it did not by naming only the unary provider.
 * `useDictationAvailability` (`speech.ensureModel`) is the unary half; the
 * AUDIO itself goes through `useVoiceDictation`, which reads
 * `useWsStreamClient()`. So the stream context is literally the transport a
 * user's microphone rides, and a stream re-provider above a composer is the
 * voice-to-the-wrong-machine outcome directly rather than by implication.
 * That population is no longer a single surface: `resource-monitor-popover`
 * was the only stream re-provider, and the epic sidebar's file tree, the git
 * diff panel, the HOST OVERVIEW (`host-settings-panel.tsx`, whose
 * `StreamRuntimeContext.Provider` carries `useScopedStreamBinding`), the
 * onboarding TOUR and `app-status-bar` are now five more, and the
 * session-import DIALOG a sixth. The Overview joined the list for its Data &
 * migration group: both rows move ONE machine's local data over a stream, so
 * the stream has to be the named host's. The tour joined it for the same
 * reason one act down — the session scan and the run it starts are that
 * machine's — and the dialog for exactly that scan and run. The strip joined
 * it because its readout rides `resources.subscribe` for the host it watches,
 * while its usage segments' reads are unary. All are safe for the same
 * positional reason as the other three — they contain no composer, a 24px
 * strip least of all, and so no path to the microphone.
 *
 * Three consumers of a re-provided stream now also CHECK it before acting,
 * because this hook's binding lands in an effect: `host-import-migration-
 * section.tsx` withholds its rows, and the tour its stages and the dialog its
 * wizard (both through `scopedHostReadiness`), until
 * `useStreamRuntimeBinding()` names the host the surface does. A re-provider
 * whose subtree starts work on one machine's data owes that check — the
 * commit after a pick is still on the ambient transport.
 *
 * Three arms, and which one you are in is the whole question:
 *
 *   - `status === "ready"` with an explicit pick re-provides `scope.client`.
 *     That client addresses the host the page names, which is what stops one
 *     host's data rendering under another host's name.
 *   - `connecting`, `unreachable` and `vanished` return null. They have no
 *     client at all, re-providing a null one would make `useHostClient()`
 *     throw, and falling back to the ambient host is the substitution above.
 *     The panels gate those states rather than render through them.
 *   - `following` NOW RE-PROVIDES TOO, and it did not used to. The old comment
 *     said the ambient binding already IS the scoped host's — true while a
 *     privileged bound host existed, and false the moment redesign P4.2
 *     deleted the active slot. The ambient binding's `hostClient` is the
 *     window's spine: it owns the messenger, coordinator and request context,
 *     and it deliberately addresses NO host, so a panel left beneath it would
 *     resolve every read against nothing.
 *
 * The `following` client is NOT re-derived here. `use-host-scope.ts` already
 * answers it — `client: status === "following" ? ambientClient : overrideClient`,
 * where `ambientClient` is `useHostClient()`, the effective host's own
 * requester. Re-deriving it in this hook would put a second decider behind the
 * same question, which is the defect the whole selection layer is being
 * rebuilt to remove. All this hook decides now is WHETHER to re-provide.
 *
 * NAMED BEHAVIOR PROPERTY of that third arm: a `following` subtree now
 * re-renders when the effective host moves, where before it re-rendered only
 * when the ambient binding itself changed. That is the point rather than a
 * cost — a following panel must re-point when the host it follows moves — and
 * it is semantics-preserving today, because today the ambient binding IS the
 * effective host's. It becomes load-bearing after the slot is gone.
 *
 * `hostId` IS THE FIELD THAT MAKES ANY OF THIS TRUE, and TypeScript cannot make
 * you set it here. The return below is a SPREAD into a declared return type, so
 * `...realBinding` already satisfies the required field with the app-wide
 * binding's `null` — the tree compiles clean while every panel silently falls
 * back to the ambient host, which is precisely the defect this closes. Nothing
 * but a test can hold this line: `window-host-client-resolution.test.tsx`
 * renders this hook and asserts the REQUEST lands on the scoped host. Delete
 * either `hostId:` below and it reddens; that is the only guard there is.
