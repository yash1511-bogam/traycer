 * - `field`: one control among other controls, inside a panel that is already
 *   open (the workspace and worktree pickers, where a search field sits right
 *   under it). A quiet fill is not enough there: everything around it is flat,
 *   so the row read as a heading with a stray chevron rather than something you
 *   could open. It borrows the search field's own border and fill, which is
 *   what makes the two read as siblings instead of as a label above a control.
 * - `inline`: a compact peer of other ghost controls below a composer. It
 *   shares their muted resting text and foreground-alpha hover, while its
 *   list still uses the same full host-row vocabulary as every other surface.
 * - `panel-header`: the picker IS the top strip of the card it heads (the
 *   header's usage popover). Here a floating list is actively wrong: a rounded
 *   panel inset inside a rounded panel puts two borders a few pixels apart on
 *   every edge, and the result reads as an unrelated menu that happened to land
 *   there rather than as this row's choices. So the trigger goes full-bleed and
 *   square, and the list drops flush from its bottom edge at exactly its width
 *   — one shared edge, one continuous surface.
 * - `status-bar`: a chip in the app's 24px bottom strip, where the height is
 *   the binding constraint and every other preset overflows it (`inline` is
 *   `h-7`, and the padded presets are taller still). It is the only preset
 *   whose list opens UPWARD, because there is nothing below the strip to open
