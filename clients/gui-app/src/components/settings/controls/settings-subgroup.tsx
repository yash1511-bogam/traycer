 * with indentation, which reads as decoration at a glance and disappears
 * entirely once two levels of it exist - which is exactly what a per-provider,
 * per-window list needs. An inset card draws the containment instead, so a
 * user can see where a subject starts and ends without counting pixels of
 * left margin.
 *
 * The title row can host the switch that owns the subgroup, and that pairing is
 * the reason this is not just a heading: a parent switch and the rows it
 * governs have to be one object on screen, or turning it off looks like the
