/**
 * The Tasks view's second section: one disclosure row per task, grouping the
 * agents running in it and the background jobs it has warm in this window.
 *
 * Two levels and no more. A task expands into WORK ROWS - agents, then jobs -
 * and an agent started by another agent stays at that level, saying `via
 * <parent>` instead of taking a third indent. The section above this one
 * ("Needs you") is never duplicated here: a task that wants the user carries a
 * noninteractive glyph and a count, and the actionable rows stay in the one
 * place they can be acted on.
 *
 * Disclosure state is each row's own `useState`, which is what makes it both
 * session-lived and self-pruning: the `<li>` is keyed by epic id, so a task
 * leaving the model unmounts its row and takes its disclosure with it, and a
 * task that comes back comes back at the section's default.
