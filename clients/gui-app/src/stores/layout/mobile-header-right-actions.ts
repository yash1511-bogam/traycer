 * a phone cold restore, where the router still sits on the landing route while
 * the restored tab fills the screen. A focused draft resolves the landing
 * terminal entry keyed by THAT draft - so switching between two mounted start
 * pages never renders the departing page's toggle across the focus commit; it
 * renders nothing until the panel's rebuild registers for the new host, the
 * same first-mount boundary every surface has. History and Settings present
 * nothing, so a registered entry from a surface merely retained behind them
 * can never leak into their header. No focus at all (an empty split slot's
 * chooser, a window with no tabs yet) also presents nothing: the toggle acts
 * on one start page's layout, and no start page is presented.

 * backgrounded shows its controls with no re-publish. That is why writers
 * register while RETAINED, not on focus: an entry that only appeared on focus
 * would trail the focus commit by its own effect flush. A surface whose first
 * mount IS the transition still registers an effect-flush later - there is
 * nothing to resolve before it exists. An entry whose surface is not presented
 * resolves to nothing, however its teardown is ordered.
