/**
 * Locks down the settings tab kind helpers around the host section.
 * The Settings sidebar's primary entry routes through these helpers, so
 * the host section needs to resolve consistently from path → section
 * id → route options. The legacy `/settings/service` path is preserved
 * as a section-level alias to the Host section so a remembered tab
 * path from before the rename still lands on the current native-
 * packaging surface (the route itself redirects).

/**
 * The gate `SETTINGS_PATHS` has never had. Three ids reached the section table

 * dropped, because both validators answer `SETTINGS_PATHS.has(path)` and a
 * section missing from it is simply not a settings route.
 *
 * Containment, deliberately not equality: the set is a SUPERSET by
 * construction. It also accepts `service`, the retired id that belongs to no
 * section and that `settings.service.tsx` still redirects, and a persisted
 * path minted by an older build is exactly the input this guards. Asserting
 * equality would fail on that alias and teach the next person to delete it.
