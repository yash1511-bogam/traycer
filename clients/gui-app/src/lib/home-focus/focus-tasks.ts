 * Whether a stop aimed at this agent would reach the machine it is running on.

 * machine that is asleep or unreachable is honestly not stoppable from here,
 * and the row says so instead of failing after the click.
 *
 * A `null` host splits in two, and the split is the whole point. `null` means
 * the stop goes to the ACTIVE host, so it is only honest when the active host
 * is in fact where the agent lives:
 *
 * - The projection RESOLVED this agent and recorded no host - a legacy chat
 *   predating the field. This window is already talking to that epic's host, so
 *   the active host is right and the row stays actionable rather than being
 *   greyed out on a technicality.
 * - Nothing resolved it: the epic is cold and {@link FocusTasksInput.coldEpicHostIds}
 *   declined to name a host, because the cloud index listed two of them (or
 *   none). That refusal is deliberate - nothing in `chatHostIds` says WHICH
 *   host a given agent id belongs to - and it must not be undone here by
 *   quietly aiming at the active host instead. A Stop that promises to reach a
 *   machine the model could not name is worse than a disabled one: `agent.stop`
 *   resolves the subtree from shared cloud storage, so the wrong host finds the
 *   agent and then tears down through ITS OWN session managers, reporting an
 *   empty `stoppedAgentIds` while the real agent keeps running.
