/**
 * The "Needs you" section: unresolved, unread prompts across every task on the
 * notification feed, in the bell's own attention order.
 *
 * THREE conditions, and all three are load-bearing (the badge
 * counts exactly these rows):
 *
 * 1. The row's kind is a pending-prompt kind. A failure row is attention too,
 *    but it is history, not a question.
 * 2. `resolvedAt === null`. A prompt answered from the chat stays in the feed
 *    with its answer recorded; it is not waiting on anyone.
 * 3. The lifecycle classifier puts it in `attention`, which for a
 *    `needs_action` row means UNREAD. A prompt whose row the user has already
 *    acknowledged is not what Home is for.
 *
 * Ordering is `compareAttentionOrder` - blocking tier first, newest first
 * within a tier, `feedId` ascending as the deterministic tie-break. The
 * provider-pack local-first re-order the bell applies is deliberately not
 * repeated: it discriminates pack-store events, which are never a prompt kind,
 * so applying it here could only be a no-op with a second ordering rule to keep
 * in step.
 *
 * `taskTitle` is resolved by the caller and looked up per row rather than
 * carried on the notification, because a cloud row's own title is the epic's
 * title AT THE TIME THE ROW WAS WRITTEN.

 *
 * Comparing by `feedId` instead is safe for the one thing `activation` is used

 * reason), and an equal-content earlier object with the same feed id IS that.

 * stable feed id still mints a new row.

 * `activation` off with a rest destructure means a field added to
