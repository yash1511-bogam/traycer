/**
 * The "Background" section: durable shells and in-turn background work, for the
 * tasks open in this window only.
 *
 * TWO PLANES, deliberately not merged. A managed command is a durable shell the
 * host owns across turns and restarts; a background item is a node of the turn
 * that is running right now. They can describe the same shell and they are
 * still different objects with different lifetimes, so the section lists both
 * and labels each - collapsing them would need an identity relation neither
 * plane publishes.
 *
 * `startedAtMs` is populated for managed commands only, because only their
 * `running` status carries one. Background items have no start timestamp on the
 * wire, which is the same gap that keeps elapsed time off the agent rows.
 *
 * `stoppable`:
 * - A managed command is stoppable whenever its host is known.
 *   `managedCommand.stop` is a UNARY RPC pinned to the command's own host
 *   (`useManagedCommandStop`), so the stop does not need the chat session that
 *   revealed the command - only the id and the machine.
 * - A background item is NOT stoppable from here. Its stop is a `chat.subscribe`
 *   ACTION on a warm session (`ChatSessionState.stopBackgroundItem`), which is
 *   a chat-scoped capability rather than a cross-task one; the row still opens
 *   the chat, where the action lives. This is the same "no unary decision RPC"
 *   shape that makes approvals click-through rather than inline.
 *
 * ORDERING groups a task's rows together and is total: epic, then chat, then
 * plane, then key. Not "newest first" - a background list that re-sorts itself
 * whenever a shell prints is harder to read than one that stays put, and
 * neither plane reports a start time for every row anyway.
