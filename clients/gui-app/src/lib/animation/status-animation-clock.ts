/**
 * One shared 25 Hz clock for every long-lived status animation: the run
 * indicator's shimmer and dots, live pulses, braille spinners.
 *
 * Why these are not CSS animations. Blink samples every running CSS / WAAPI
 * animation on the main thread once per display frame and marks its element
 * for style recalc - whether or not the animation is composited, and `steps()`
 * timing does not change that. Each recalc against this app's stylesheet
 * allocates a few KB of Blink (Oilpan) garbage, so a single always-on run
 * indicator at 120 Hz measured ~2.5 MB/s of C++ heap churn, four running
 * chats ~10 MB/s. Oilpan only collects every ~300 MB, keeps the freed pages
 * pooled, and V8's memory reducer never runs while the allocation rate stays
 * that high - the renderer ratcheted to 1.5 GB and stayed there.
 *
 * Writing inline styles from one `setInterval` keeps the visuals, costs a
 * fraction of the recalcs, batches every indicator on screen into ONE
 * style/layout/paint pass per tick instead of one per indicator, and stops
 * while the document is hidden.
 *
 * The interval ticks at 25 Hz and each writer picks its cadence as a multiple
 * of that. A sweeping highlight band is motion the eye tracks continuously,
 * and at 12.5 Hz it visibly steps (~7% of a title per frame); its writes
 * measured in the noise, so it runs every tick. A 1 s ping ring or a 1.4 s
 * dot bounce reads fine at 12.5 Hz, and the rings were the one writer with a
 * measurable cost, so they take every second tick.
 *
 * Reduced motion is honoured live: the clock does not tick while
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` matches, and `useStatusAnimation` clears its
 * element's inline styles the moment the preference turns on, so the
 * stylesheet's static reduced-motion rules stand; when it turns off again the
 * animations resume.
 *
 * `elapsedMs` is a logical clock (ticks x tick length), not wall time: it
 * freezes while hidden - like a CSS animation would - and is deterministic
 * under fake timers.

 * turning on - so the stylesheet's static rules take over. Keep both
 * referentially stable (`useCallback`): the effect resubscribes when either
 * changes. Under reduced motion neither runs and nothing subscribes.
 *
 * The target may be an HTML or an SVG element - both carry the inline `style`
 * a writer writes, and a glyph animated in place (a chip's lucide icon) is an
 * `<svg>`, not a wrapper around one.
 *
 * Each tick re-reads `ref`, so a host element swapped underneath the same
 * component (a polymorphic `as` prop) picks up the animation on the next tick.
 * `cadenceMs` is one of the `STATUS_ANIMATION_*_CADENCE_MS` constants.
 *
 * A pane kept mounted but hidden (`TopLevelTabHost` keeps inactive tabs under
 * `display:none`) cannot paint, so its writers unsubscribe while the pane is
 * hidden (`usePaneVisible`, `true` outside a pane) and resume on the next show
 * - the same gate the stream flush coordinator's hidden tier follows.
