/**
 * What a section BELONGS to — the organising idea of the whole surface.
 *
 * Settings used to be one flat list in which "Appearance" (this app),
 * "Sessions" (your account) and "Providers" (one specific host) were
 * indistinguishable peers. Nothing said which of them followed you between
 * hosts, and four sections quietly grew their own host dropdown to cover for
 * it.
 *
 * The fix is a SCOPE, not a level. Settings has already spent its nesting
 * budget inside Providers — that panel is a rail plus a per-provider tab bar,
 * so the sidebar itself gets exactly one level and the host cannot become
 * another one. The host group is therefore headed by ONE picker, and
 * everything under it is scoped by that pick. Depth stays flat; the rule ("if
 * it varies by host it sits under the picker") becomes structural rather than
 * memorised.

 * scoped — it carries the picker, and everything beneath the picker belongs
 * to whichever host that picker names.

// No `requiresLocalHost` flag any more. It marked Shell and Diagnostics as
// reachable only while the selected host was the one running on this computer,
// because both were backed by the on-disk config store through the local CLI
// bridge. `config.*` / `diagnostics.*` retired that limit: every section here
// reads the selected host over its own RPC, so no row can be unreachable for a
// reason the sidebar would have to encode. (The one surviving local path —
// this computer's host with its process stopped — is a per-panel FALLBACK that
// keeps those pages working, not a restriction on reaching them.)

/**
 * Order is meaningful twice over: it drives the leader-digit shortcuts
 * (`dispatch.ts` indexes positionally, through `visibleSettingsSections()`
 * below, which preserves this order) and it groups the sidebar. Entries must
 * stay contiguous per group or the sidebar renders a group heading twice.
 *
 * Only the first ten entries can carry a digit
 * (`SINGLE_DIGIT_LEADER_INDEX_LIMIT`), and there are now seventeen. The whole
 * host group - Overview, Providers, Worktrees, the host's Notifications, Agent
 * selection, Shell and Diagnostics - is the eleventh through seventeenth and
 * goes without. Overview is the newest to lose one, to Layout taking the
 * seventh Application slot.
 *
 * Worktrees is the one that lost a digit to the app-scoped Sounds
 * entry below. That follows from keeping Application entries together at the
 * start: giving Worktrees its digit back would require shortcut order to
 * diverge from both sidebar reading order and command-palette row order.
 *
 * Section `id`s are a compatibility surface — routes (`/settings/<id>`), the
 * settings-modal panel table, the command palette and remembered tab paths key
 * off them — so ids never change even when labels do.
 *
 * The rail label names WHAT the page controls; the group heading names WHOSE
 * it is. Two pages that control the same thing at two scopes share word and
 * icon (Diagnostics). Two pages that control different things get different
 * words and icons (Sounds vs Notifications). Surfaces with no scope carrier
 * qualify the label themselves — report-issue route labels already do
 * ("App diagnostics" / "Host diagnostics"). The mobile header still shows
 * the bare section label; that case is unresolved, not an example of the rule.
 * Putting the group word into a row the heading already scopes is the
 * inconsistent move, not the consistent one.

/**
 * Sections the installed mobile app does not offer. Two different reasons sit

 *
 * - **Keybindings — the shell cannot drive it.** Every chord is captured from
 *   a `keydown` on `window` (`chord-capture-core.tsx`), a binding is cleared
 *   with Backspace and committed by the next full chord, so on a touch shell
 *   the chip arms to "Press chord…" and can never resolve, and an existing
 *   binding can never be removed. A section whose every control needs a
 *   hardware keyboard is a dead end on a phone, not a sparse page.
 * - **Link mobile app — the role is backwards.** The panel DISPLAYS a QR and a
 *   one-time code for another device to read, and in the mobile app that
 *   device is the one holding the panel: the phone is the SCANNER
 *   (`link-code-sign-in.tsx` redeems a code this panel mints, and its own copy
 *   says "On your desktop, open Settings → Link mobile app"). A phone could
 *   physically show the code to a second phone, so this is a product decision
 *   about which end of the pairing each build is, not an inability.
