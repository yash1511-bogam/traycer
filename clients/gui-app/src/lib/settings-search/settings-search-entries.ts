 * Worktrees inventory, the Host overview) with no row primitive to walk.
 * Nothing here can be derived from types. The price of hand-writing it is
 * drift, which is why every anchor is source-scanned by
 * `__tests__/settings-search-index.test.ts` rather than trusted.
 *
 * Coverage is honest about that split. Pages built on `SettingsRow` /
 * `SettingsGroup` are indexed down to the row; bespoke pages are indexed at
 * the page and region level with a keyword set rich enough to reach them.
 * A hit that lands one scroll from the control is a good outcome; a hit that
 * lands nowhere is not, so no entry promises an anchor a panel may not render.
 *
 * Labels and descriptions are COPIED from the surface, not paraphrased. A
 * result whose words differ from the row it lands on reads as the wrong
 * result, so a label change in a panel is a change here too.
