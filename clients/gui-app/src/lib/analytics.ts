   * surface would have answered it by breaking the entry-point series
   * instead, and `AnalyticsSource` is shared with a dozen unrelated events.
   * A new dimension costs nothing; a re-valued one costs the history.
   *
   * `null` where there is no in-app surface (the native menu). Safe to send:
   * `host-failure-report.ts` states the contract these values are built to -
   * categorical phase names, "never paths, error text or anything the user
