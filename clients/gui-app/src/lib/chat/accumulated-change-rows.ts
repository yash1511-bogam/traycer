/**
 * # What the accumulated-changes panel renders, on either line
 *
 * The pinned panel above the composer lists every file the chat has touched.
 * It used to take the host's `ChatAccumulatedFileChange` directly - a row
 * carrying the file's whole before AND after contents - and derive the `+`/`-`
 * from them.
 *
 * On the windowed line those contents do not arrive (D7): the snapshot carries
 * SUMMARIES, and contents come from `chat.readAccumulatedFileChange` when a
 * diff is actually opened. So the panel cannot keep taking a content-bearing
 * type, and this is what it takes instead.
 *
 * ## It is content-free on purpose
 *
 * The panel never rendered the contents. It rendered two numbers derived from
 * them, and everything else it shows - the path, the operation, the artifact
 * tag, whether the row can be reverted - was already metadata. Making that
 * explicit is most of the work: once the row carries `counts` rather than two
 * file bodies, the windowed line has nothing left to be missing, and the
 * pre-windowed line loses a per-render diff of every file the chat has touched.
 *
 * The contents remain exactly one surface's business - the diff tile a row
 * click opens - and that surface fetches them by {@link AccumulatedChangeRow.digest}.

 *
 * ## The HOST list is the order, not the rendered rows
 *
 * The panel's documented order is first-touched across the whole chat, and the
 * host's list is already exactly that - `computeAccumulatedFileChanges` walks
 * `earliestEntriesByPath(chat.events)`, whose insertion order IS whole-history
 * first touch. Deriving the order from the rendered rows instead agreed with it
 * only while those rows WERE the whole chat.
 *
 * On the windowed line they are not: `messages` is the hydrated tail, so every
 * file the recent turns touched sorted ahead of files first touched earlier in
 * unhydrated history, and the panel resorted itself as spans hydrated and were
 * evicted. Taking the host's order fixes that at the root and needs no
 * line-conditional, because the host's answer is the same definition on both.
 *
 * What the rendered rows still supply is the TAIL of the list: a path the host
 * has no row for is one no completed turn has touched, so the active turn is
 * its first toucher and it belongs after everything the host knows.
 *
 * (A file reverted mid-chat leaves the host's list and re-enters at its true
 * first-touch position on the next refresh, so it appears at the end for the
 * rest of the running turn. Same reorder the previous shape had, and the host's
 * refresh is what settles it either way.)
 *
 * A host row WINS wholesale wherever one exists. That is deliberate and
 * predates this: mid-turn the host's number is one turn stale, and showing a
 * stale number for a file the host knows beats showing a per-edit number that
 * means something different from every other row in the list.
